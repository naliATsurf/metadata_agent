"""
Execution topology definitions for the multi-agent system.

This module defines EXECUTION_TOPOLOGIES - how plans are executed, including:
- How many players work on each step in parallel
- How many debate rounds occur within each step
- Which player roles are available in the pool

Player configurations (PLAYER_CONFIGS) are defined in src/players/configs.py

Note: The orchestrator automatically adds 'relationship_analyst' to the player
pool for multi-context dataset analysis. No need for separate multi-context topologies.
