"""
Player configurations for the multi-agent system.

This module defines the available player roles with their prompts and tools.
Players are instantiated from these configs at runtime.

Uses the unified ExecutionContext tools for all data access.

Note: model_name and temperature are optional - if not specified,
the defaults from config.py will be used.
